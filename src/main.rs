// The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks
// to the main function is common to many binary projects.
// As a result, the Rust community has developed a type of guideline process for
// splitting the separate concerns of a binary program when main starts getting large.

//The process has the following steps:
// Split your program into a main.rs and a lib.rs, and move your programâ€™s logic to lib.rs.
//
// While your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in main.rs.
//
// When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from main.rs and move it to lib.rs.
//
// The responsibilities that remain in the main function after this process should be limited to:
//
// Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
// Setting up any other configuration
// Calling a run function in lib.rs
// Handling the error if run returns an error
